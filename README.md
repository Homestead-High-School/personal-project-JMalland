# Advanced PIP: Scrabble
Final project for Advanced Programming

For what its worth, I don't mind much if I don't update this as regularily as I should. I much prefer to have a better working application that nice, neat text in a README file.

# 11/1/22 ~ 11/3/22: Building Classes
  I've been building the base case for each class for the Board and Scrabble class. So far, I've built an application window featuring a 15x15 grid of tiles that build the Scrabble board. 
  My Scrabble class, however, I've built the base features to place letters corresponding to specific coordinates. Using an algorithm I built to custom sort TreeMaps, I then check whether or not all added letters form valid words from my dictionary file.
